Contributing
------------

Contributions to libneo4j-omni are encouraged and should be made via pull
requests made to the [GitHub repository](
https://github.com/majensen/libneo4j-omni). Please include test cases where
possible, and use a style and approach consistent with what @cleishm
has used in the rest of the library.

It may be worthwhile raising an issue on github for the contribution you
intend to make before developing the code, to allow for discussion and feedback
on the requirements.

To have `make check` run the tests, [Check](https://libcheck.github.io/check/)
needs to be installed before running `configure`.
